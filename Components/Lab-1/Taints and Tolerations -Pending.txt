kubectl taint --help

Update the taints on one or more nodes. 

  * A taint consists of a key, value, and effect. As an argument here, it is expressed as key=value:effect.  

  * The key must begin with a letter or number, and may contain letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, and underscores, up to

253 characters.  

  * Optionally, the key can begin with a DNS subdomain prefix and a single '/', like example.com/my-app  

  * The value must begin with a letter or number, and may contain letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, and underscores, up

to  63 characters.  

  * The effect must be NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule or NoExecute.  

  * Currently taint can only apply to node.

Examples:

  # Update node 'foo' with a taint with key 'dedicated' and value 'special-user' and effect 'NoSchedule'.

  # If a taint with that key and effect already exists, its value is replaced as specified.

  kubectl taint nodes foo dedicated=special-user:NoSchedule

  # Remove from node 'foo' the taint with key 'dedicated' and effect 'NoSchedule' if one exists.

  kubectl taint nodes foo dedicated:NoSchedule-
